### PodAsk

**From Passive Listening to Interactive Understanding**

- An AI-driven system making podcasts interactive  
- Turning hard-to-reach academic content into engaging dialogue

## 2. The Problem: Academic Content Is Hard to Access

**Dense material vs. modern learning needs**

- **Reality:** Students are confronted with massive amounts of academic material that is time-consuming and exhausting to consume.
- **Hurdle:** Content is locked in rigid, text-heavy formats that don’t match how people learn today.
- **Consequence:** Low motivation, shallow engagement, and avoidance of learning altogether.

**Core Problem:**  
> “I don’t want to go through all this hard-to-reach academic stuff.  
> I want something easily digestible — and interactive.”

## 3. The Solution: From Static Text to Interactive Dialogue

PodAsk transforms academic content into **interactive podcasts**.

- **Simplification:** Complex → Clear  
- **Interactivity:** Listen → Interrupt → Ask
