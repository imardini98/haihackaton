Slide 1 – The Market Problem

Headline (large):
Students are overwhelmed by information — not understanding.

Content (short bullets):

Target users: University students (Bachelor, Master, PhD), especially STEM, medicine, economics

Academic literature is dense and time-consuming

Podcasts are passive and ask the host’s questions

Many niche or new topics have no podcast

Students finish learning with unanswered questions

Footer insight (small):
Information exists. Understanding does not.

Slide 2 – The Solution

Headline (large):
A podcast built around your curiosity.

One-sentence description:
PodAsk turns any topic or question into a podcast you can interrupt and question in real time.

Supporting bullets:

User starts with a topic or a general question

PodAsk generates a guided podcast explanation

Users interrupt anytime to ask deeper questions

Listening continues seamlessly

Tagline (small):
From listening → to understanding.

Slide 3 – Business Model

Slide 4 – Go-to-Market

Headline (large):
How we get our first users.

Content (bullets):

Slide 5 – Why Us / Why Now

Headline (large):
Why now. Why us.

Two-column layout:

Why now

Explosion of research and complexity

Students overloaded, not under-informed

Real-time synthesis is now possible

Why us

Working prototype built in under 48 hours

Clear focus on one core learning experience

Strong belief in curiosity-driven education

Closing statement (bold):
We would work on this full-time if it gains traction.
