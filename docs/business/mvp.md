# PodAsk – MVP Definition

This document defines the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for PodAsk.
The goal of the MVP is to validate the core learning experience:
**interactive understanding through audio-first interaction**.

---

## 🎯 MVP Goal

Demonstrate that users gain **more understanding with less friction**
by transforming academic content into an **interactive podcast**.

The MVP focuses on:
- clarity over completeness
- experience over feature breadth
- learning impact over technical perfection

---

## 🧠 Core User Problem

Users do not want to consume academic content in rigid, text-heavy formats.
They want something:
- easily digestible
- accessible on the go
- interactive when confusion arises

## ✋ Core MVP Feature (Non-Negotiable)

**Raise Hand Interaction**

The defining feature of PodAsk:

1. User listens to an audio explanation
2. User presses ✋ at any moment
3. Playback pauses
4. User asks a question
5. PodAsk answers **in spoken language**
6. Audio resumes at the correct position

If a feature does **not** improve this interaction, it is **out of scope**.

2. System performs autonomous research
3. Content is synthesized into a podcast-style script
