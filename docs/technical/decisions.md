# Key Decisions – PodAsk

This document records the **most important product and strategy decisions**
made during the development of PodAsk.

Its purpose is to explain *why* certain directions were chosen — and others deliberately not.

## Decision 1: From Newsletter Podcasts to Academic Learning

### Initial Idea
PodAsk initially started as a tool to convert **newsletters into podcasts**.
The goal was to help users save time by listening instead of reading through multiple newsletters.

This addressed a convenience problem:
- Too many newsletters
- Limited attention
- Desire to consume content on the go

---

### Observation
While this use case saved time, the **pain point was relatively low**:
- Users were inconvenienced, not blocked
- Skipping newsletters did not have serious consequences

In contrast, students face:
- strict deadlines
- exam pressure
- mandatory material
- real consequences if content is not understood

---

### Strategic Shift
We decided to pivot towards **students and academic content** because:

- The pain point is **significantly higher**
- Time pressure is real and unavoidable
- Understanding is critical, not optional
- Existing solutions are rigid and outdated

Students are not just trying to *save time* —  
they are trying to **keep up and succeed**.

---

### Outcome
PodAsk focuses on transforming **hard-to-access academic content**
into **interactive, easily digestible learning experiences**.

This decision shaped:
- the audio-first approach
- the ✋ interruption feature
- the focus on understanding rather than content consumption

---

## Decision 2: Focus on Interaction, Not Just Audio

Once the student use case was clear, it became obvious that
**passive listening alone is not enough**.

Understanding requires:
- interruption
- clarification
- dialogue

This led to the ✋ “Raise Hand” interaction becoming the **core feature** of PodAsk.

## Guiding Principle

> PodAsk does not optimize for convenience.  
> It optimizes for understanding under time pressure.
